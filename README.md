# UCE_deprecated

These are the deprecated early sources of the UCE framework. This
repository only holds the sources and no build files since the build
process is essentially broken. There are a number of dependencies which
are neither documented nor resolved. This source code is provided
primarily for educational purposes.

The framework is currently refactored and under heavy development. The
refactored version will gradually be published in the
[UCE repository](https://github.com/htwg/UCE).

For more information about UCE see the [project page](http://ice.in.htwg-konstanz.de/). On the [project download page](http://ice.in.htwg-konstanz.de/downloads.html) you can also find the published jar archives. 

Do not hesitate to contact us if you are interested in helping in the project.
