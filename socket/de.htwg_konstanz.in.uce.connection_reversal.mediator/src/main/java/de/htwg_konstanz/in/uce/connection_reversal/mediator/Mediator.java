/**
 * Main-Class which starts the Mediator functionality
 * 
 * Mediator is an public accessible Server where clients (targets) can be registered.
 * If another client (source) wants to access to a registered client (target)
 * it sends a request to Mediator, which will help to connect these clients.
 * 
 * For connecting the clients it is necessary that one of those clients (target) runs
 * as ConnectionReversalTarget and the other client (source) runs as ConnectionReversalSource.
 * 
 * The target client can be behind a NAT-Router, the source client must be accessible for the public
